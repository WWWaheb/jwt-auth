## Endpoints
| Method | URL | Description |
| ------:| --- | ----------- |
| `GET` | `/health` | Healthcheck  which returns Code 200|
| `POST` | `/auth/token` | Get JWT token by passing user credentials `{ "user": "name", "password": "secret"}` |
| `POST` | `/auth/refresh` | Refresh token with a new one by passing the old valid one `{ "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUz..." }` |
| `POST` | `/auth/check` | Checks the token and returns code 200 with Headers: `X-Auth-Id` with user id and `X-Auth-User` with user name |
